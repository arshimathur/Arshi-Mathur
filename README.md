### Hi there
# About me.

I'm a passionate tech enthusiast with a strong foundation in software development and a keen interest in emerging technologies.
My journey has been hands-on, with experience in languages like Java and C, where I've developed skills in data structures, algorithms, and optimization techniques. From mastering array manipulations and working with linked lists to building efficient sorting and search algorithms, I enjoy solving complex problems and continually challenging myself.

Recently, I've delved into cybersecurity through a certification course, expanding my knowledge in protecting digital environments and understanding cybersecurity threats. Alongside this, I'm exploring AI tools and estimation theory, driven by a curiosity for the role of data in modern decision-making and artificial intelligence. Iâ€™m always eager to learn new skills, tackle new challenges, and contribute meaningfully to the tech community.
